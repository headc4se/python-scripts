This is a collection of python scripts and utilities that I've created mainly for in-house use.

**cmdb**

A 'cheatsheet' utility for commonly used command line inputs. Cmdb stores the command, tags, and code examples in MongoDB, it also features an interactive editor for entries in database. There are still bugs to be ironed out, and features to be added, but it works fairly reliably.

**snippets**

A 'cheatsheet' utility for generic code structures and operations. Snippets stores the function, tags, and code example in MongoDB. Snippets is useful for
 referencing functions or code that may not be commonly used.
